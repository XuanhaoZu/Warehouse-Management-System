**VISIBILITY OF ORDER STATUS**
One of the key features included within the order summary page is a pie chart. This pie chart is used to help customers see the status of their order. From the beginning, where the user's order is confirmed and being prepared, right through to the end, when their order has been delivered. This particular feature meets Nielson’s first heuristic principle, visibility of system status. 

**MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND REAL WORLD**
Another key feature of our applicaiton was creating a match between the system and the real world so that the program could easily communicate different functions to the user. For example, the user would be able to easily recongise that 'Sign in' and 'Sign up' mean that they can either log in to the application or register another account to the application. 

**USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM**
On the Data Management Screen, the user can log out of the application whenever they choose. This enhances the user's control and freedom within the application.

**CORRECT FORM**  
In addition to the features implemented to match the ideals and theories of Nielson and Norman, we have taken the time to ensure the User Interface has the correct form. This can be seen in that we ensured that we used a Password field for passwords instead of a text field on the login and sign up page. 

**ERROR PREVENTION**  
Within our user interface, we implemented tools and techniques that help prevent user errors. In particular, a combo box has been used in the “Create and Delete Orders” user interface. This combo box allows the user to select an existing supplier that has been created in the”Suppliers” user interface. This matches Nielson’s  fourth heuristic, Error Prevention, as it prevents users from accidentally typing in the wrong supplier name, otherwise considered the universally unique identifier, as it allows the user to select the supplier from the combo box. We also aimed to provide good error messages to the user(s). An example of this is on the 'Sign in' screen where the if the user enters an incorrect username or password, they will be notified of it. 

**CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS**  
In order to make the application easy for our users to navigate, we tried to make the user interfaces as consistent as possible, so we could meet Nielson’s sixth heuristic principle, Consistency and Standards. Throughout the application, features that allow users to add, delete and edit information are featured on multiple interfaces, with a consistent layout and use. The application also provides tabs in the top bar that lead to different pages on all the user interfaces, excluding the login and signin interfaces.  The links in the top bar stay in the following order no matter what page the user is on (Home, About, Settings, Log Out). 
 
**HELP AND DOCUMENTATION**   
HELP USERS RECOGNISE, DIAGNOSE AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS / FEEDBACK 

**REDUCE CLUTTER**  
In order to reduce clutter within the application, the tabs that allow the user to get to different pages have been divided between the toolbar and the sidebar. We decided to put tabs that deal with user management in the toolbar and tabs that are functionalities of the app in the sidebar, in order to meet Norman’s suggestion of reducing clutter. This helps make the application easier to navigate.   

**FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE**
The user can edit information by pressing ENTER on their keyboards.

**HELP USERS RECOGNISE AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS**
The user will be notified when they have done something in the application that is erroneous. For example, when they try to enter an incorrect password they will be notified about it.
