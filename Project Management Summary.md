Before designing our application, our team discussed a variety of methodologies that would help our project progress in a logical and timely matter. After comparing other methodologies such as Agile Development and the Waterfall Model, our team decided to adopt a SCRUM approach. Adopting the scrum approach during the development of our application was necessary and beneficial for this project, in particular due to current circumstances. 

Our “Inventory Management Application” had to be created within a small time frame of just under four weeks, with a group of four people, who were located across Australia. This meant our team needed to have regular communication, in order to ensure that the project is completed and the programming and user interfaces are consistent.

The first step within our scrum project management plan was creating a product backlog (What is a Product Backlog?, 2020). Although most of the requirements were outlined within the assessment outline, there were some addition features our team wanted to add, that we considered requirements. These additional features were included in section third of the sprint. Although we considered these features important and necessary, they were only included in the third section of the sprint as the other functional requirements were outlined and marked according to the assessment outline. This means if requirements were not completed within section three of the sprint, our team would regardless fulfil the basic deliverables of the assessment. 

Before we started programming and designing our user interfaces, our team took the time to conduct a sprint planning meeting (Wilson, 2020). Within this meeting, our team discussed the importance of each requirement, and categorised them accordingly.

Although creating a timeline in which our team expected each task or requirement to be completed gave the team a tentative structure, it was important we were realistic and flexible, as their was the possibility our team would need to adapt our plan to ensure task completion. In order to ensure our team was aware of any setbacks or issues, we decided to do daily stand up meetings (Wilson, 2020). Everyday our team discuss the project and tasks. Within our daily stand up meetings, we discussed how our each team member was coping with task, as well as whether they expect to complete their task within the timeframe originally planned. This helped us keep everyone accountable and allowed us to change how the tasks were divided, based on how difficult the team perceived them to be or how long it took each individual completed their task. 

Adopting a scrum approach to create our application was essential, as it allowed us to create a project management plan that catered to schedules and ensured the application was finished within the given timeframe. Following scrum methodology allowed our group to work efficiently as a team, and gave us the opportunity to adapt our application or project management approach to resolve issues and help each other, without causing stress or creating a heavy workload.

The group assignment for members in the group to collaborate together and apply the knowledge studied in the course INFS2605. The group use some tools to make sure the completion of the assignment.
1. GitHub: The group use GitHub as a data transfer and storage platform to store and share the latest code to everyone in the GitHub team. The changes in code could be see so that group members can work together to push the completion of assignment. 
2. Messenger: The basic way of communication the group use is Messenger. In this way the group making plan, showing the progress of the assignment, changing idea, sharing new information. This communication tool make sure every one in the group can know latest progress and what the group need to do next step. 
3. Google Drive: The group still use Google Drive to share text file such as the Task of assignment and Usability Summary.
